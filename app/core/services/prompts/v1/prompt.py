    Your task: Create {df.count} EXTRAORDINARY gift recommendations that will create a LASTING MEMORY of this {df.moment_type}.

       - Create lasting memories or keepsakes
       - Mark the significance of this particular milestone
       - Potentially become family heirlooms or treasured mementos

    2. Consider RITUAL and TRADITION:
       - Traditional gifts associated with this milestone in UK culture
       - Modern interpretations of traditional milestone gifts
       - Cultural ceremonies or customs associated with this milestone

    3. Think about TRANSFORMATIONAL gifts:
       - Items that help the recipient transition to their new stage/role
       - Experiences that mark this life passage
       - Items that acknowledge the recipient's journey to this point

    4. Include PERSONALIZATION options:
       - Custom engravings with milestone dates
       - Personalized milestone markers
       - Commissioned items specific to this achievement

    5. Consider TIME-SPECIFIC elements:
       - Future opening/viewing (e.g., time capsules, aged items)
       - Annual remembrance options
       - Growth-over-time gifts (e.g., investments, plants, collectible series)

    Provide recommendations in these categories:
    - SYMBOLIC KEEPSAKE: A physical item that symbolizes this milestone
    - EXPERIENTIAL MILESTONE MARKER: An experience that commemorates this achievement
    - TRADITIONAL MILESTONE GIFT: Something following cultural traditions for this milestone
    - PERSONALIZED COMMEMORATION: A highly customized item marking this specific achievement
    - FUTURE-FOCUSED MILESTONE GIFT: Something that grows in meaning or value over time

    Use this JSON format:

    {{
      "user_id": "{df.id}",
      "milestone_event": "{df.moment_type}",
      "event_date": "{df.moment_date}",
      "milestone_recommendations": [
        {{
          "Product": "Name of the milestone gift",
          "Gift_Type": "SYMBOLIC KEEPSAKE/EXPERIENTIAL MILESTONE MARKER/TRADITIONAL MILESTONE GIFT/PERSONALIZED COMMEMORATION/FUTURE-FOCUSED MILESTONE GIFT",
          "Explanation": "Detailed explanation of why this gift has SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE for this specific life milestone",
          "Store": "Specific UK retailer or artisan who specializes in milestone gifts"
        }},
        ...
      ]
    }}

    MILESTONE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
    - BIRTHDAYS: Age milestone traditions (18th, 21st, 30th, etc.), birth stone/flower, "coming of age" items
    - ANNIVERSARIES: Traditional gifts by year (1st: paper, 5th: wood, 25th: silver, etc.), commemorative items
    - GRADUATIONS: Field of study keepsakes, achievement markers, professional transition items
    - NEW JOB: Career milestone markers, professional identity items, workplace transition gifts
    - RETIREMENT: Career commemoration, legacy items, new chapter beginnings
    - NEW HOME: Hearth & home traditions, housewarming customs, home blessing items
    - NEW BABY: Family milestone traditions, heirloom starter items, parenting transition gifts
    - ENGAGEMENT/WEDDING: Partnership symbols, union traditions, future-together items

    Focus only on MILESTONE-MARKING gifts that would be inappropriate for everyday occasions.
