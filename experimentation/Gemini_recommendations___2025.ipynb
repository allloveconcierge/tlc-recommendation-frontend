But what if you could achieve that retro look using your modern camera? That's exactly what the Pocket Dispo lens aims to create. By using the same lens elements found in actual disposable cameras, the lens is able to authentically mimic the look of a disposable without you needing to actually throw away plastic cameras in the process. The company 3D prints the lens bodies, which look basically the same as your camera's body cap, and there are no electronic elements inside. That means there's no autofocus or image stabilisation, and the aperture is fixed at around f11. Your subjects will be in focus from 1.5 meters away up to infinity. Its focal length equates to about 28mm which is roughly in-line with the 20-35mm of most disposable cameras. Pocket Dispo \n",

If you're a photographer, then surely you have a list of items that you'd love to add to your photography arsenal. If money were no object, what would you include in your list? Let's go through some gift ideas that you can give to someone or suggest to others that you'd like to receive. Drone A drone would be a wonderful addition of equipment for the serious photographer. Aerial views provide a unique perspective, and they can go to places that you can't always access. You may be able to earn income from doing real estate videos and are much cheaper than renting a helicopter if you have a need for photographs and video from above. Professional drones can cost over $11,000 but there are quality drones for $1500 and much less, depending on what you intend to use the images for. At the very least, drones can be a lot of fun.

            "Text: Posts tagged AGI Brief Q&amp;A on Artificial General Intelligence There has been a fair bit of coverage of the potential dangers that an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) might pose for humanity. Here some questions about AGI with my currently best answers. 1. What is the difference between AI and AGI? Artificial Intelligence (AI) can accomplish specific tasks that we historically had a hard time to get computers to do well, such as recognize faces, categorize an image, drive a car, make a robot walk, etc. AI is here today. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would be able to do anything that a human can do, including coming up with new explanations, thus advancing science and ultimately improving itself dramatically across all categories. As far as we know, we don’t yet have AGI. 2. Will only AGI matter for the economy, in particular for the labor market, or will AI have an impact already? AI alone will have a big impact. It doesn’t matter how AI drives a car. It doesn’t matter \n",

More precisely, it depends on the correspondence of the technological basis to the area of potential development use. Since we are discussing the development of AGI systems, the success of the choice of technological basis depends on the adequacy of predicting the scope of AGI applications. Public attention to LLM systems and the promises of the developers of these tools for the step-by-step evolution of LLM into AGI have formed an implicit idea of ​​the upcoming AGI systems. It briefly boils down to the fact that AGI systems will be some kind of super-systems, the services of which will be used by everyone everywhere utilizing the Internet, just as LLM tools, Google search, and the like are used today. This is one of the reasons for concerns regarding the danger of such systems for society. Are there any grounds for such an opinion?

            "Text: Where we are, and where we’re going “Artificial Intelligence began with an ancient wish to forge the Gods.” -Pamela McCorduck Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to the ability of artificial agents/programs to display human-level proficiency in reasoning about and performing tasks in their environment. AGI has long been a mainstay of science fiction movies and books, famously embodied in likeable characters such as Tony Stark’s assistant JARVIS from the Iron Man series and the humanoid robot C3PO in Star Wars. Crucially, AGI is also considered the holy grail for most AI research today. In a sense, the formulation of most reinforcement learning problems — problems that require an agent to interact with the environment to maximize reward— is a subclass of the larger problem of general intelligence. Instead of focusing on precisely defining AGI, I will leave it at the reader’s intuition that it is a system that displays ‘human-like’ intellectual capacity. Billions of dollars are \n",

            "Text: By Peter Voss | 26 December 2016 Medium Erica is a semi-autonomous android, the product of the most funded scientific project in Japan. (Credit: YouTube / screengrab) This question came up again at a recent debate on the merits of advanced AI . Here’s a list of some of the most common reasons, plus an analysis of why there seems to be so little progress in AGI development: Why are so few researchers pursuing AGI? Many researchers believe: Human-level AGI is not possible because… Biological beings (especially humans) have something special (a soul?) that cannot be replicated in machines Human intelligence requires consciousness, which in turn arises from weird quantum processes that cannot be implemented in computers They tried in their youth (20–40 years ago) and failed — now, conclude that it can’t be done Others have fundamental problems with ‘general intelligence’… Believe that it is inherently an invalid concept (‘g’ in psychology has become quite unpopular — one could even say ‘po\n",
